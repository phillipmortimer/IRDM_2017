# IRDM 2017 Group Project
## Option 2: Learning to Rank
### Group 42: I-Horng Huang, Tom Jakab, Phillip Mortimer

## Folder structure

### code

There are sub-folders for each algorithm used:

AdaRank
LambdaMART
RankNet
logistic_regression

The logistic regression folder contains out own Python implementation of the logistic regression classifier, multi-layer perceptron classifer, and the NDCG and ERR metrics.

### document

This document contains the LaTeX file for the group report and images used in the figures.

### model

This folder contains saved models for the RankLib algorithms, as well as log files saved during the hyper-parameter search performed for each algorithm.
 
### RankLib

The .jar file for the RankLib library

## Pre-requisites

The Python code is written in Python 3.5.  The logistic regression and MLP implementations require the following packages:
- SciKit learn
- TensorFlow version 1.0 or greater
- Keras 2.0 or greater

## How to run the code

RankLib algorithms:
